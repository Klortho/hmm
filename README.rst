Introduction: what is hmm?
--------------------------

**hmm** is a pure-Python module for constructing hidden Markov models.
It provides the ability to create arbitrary HMMs of a specified topology,
and to calculate the most probable path of states that explains a given
sequence of observations using the Viterbi algorithm, or by enumerating
every possible path (for small models and short observations).

It is currently intended for educational purposes only.

Prerequisites
-------------

**hmm** has been tested with Python version 2.6.
